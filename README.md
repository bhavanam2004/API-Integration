*description of API-Integration Task*: The Weather App is a full-stack web application designed to provide real-time weather updates for any

city worldwide. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the app retrieves and displays essential weather details such as temperature, weather 

conditions, and location information. The frontend of the application is built with React.js, utilizing functional components and hooks for 

efficient state management, while the backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js to handle API requests securely. By implementing a backend 

layer, the application ensures that API keys are not exposed on the client side, enhancing security.

This application offers several features, including real-time weather updates based on user input. Users can enter the name of any city, and 

the app fetches live weather data, displaying it in degrees Celsius. Along with the temperature, it also provides a short description of the 

weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, cloudy, or rain). The app also displays the country associated with the searched city for better clarity. 

To enhance user experience, it includes proper error handling by alerting users when an invalid city is entered or if the API fails to fetch 

data due to network issues. The application is built with a responsive user interface, ensuring accessibility across different devices.

The tech stack for this project includes React.js for the frontend, which handles the user interface, and Node.js with Express.js for the 

backend, which processes API requests and secures the API key. Additionally, MongoDB can be integrated in the future to store search history 

and enhance user experience. The app also leverages Fetch API for making asynchronous HTTP requests. The backend setup includes Express.js for 

handling routes and API requests, along with dotenv for managing environment variables.

To set up the project, users need to install Node.js, MongoDB (optional), and npm for managing dependencies. The repository can be cloned 

using git clone, and the backend can be initialized by installing dependencies and running the server with npm start. A .env file should be 

created in the backend to store API keys and database credentials securely. The frontend setup follows a similar process, requiring dependency 

installation and launching the React development server.

Upon launching the app, users will see a search bar where they can enter a city name and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch weather 

details. The app then displays the city name, country, current temperature in Celsius, and weather conditions. If an invalid city is entered, 

an alert notifies the user. The backend fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and ensures secure handling of API requests.

Several common issues may arise, such as invalid API key errors (which require ensuring the API key is active) or frontend data-fetching 

issues (which can be fixed by verifying that the backend server is running). In the future, the app can be enhanced by adding a 5-day weather 

forecast, user authentication for saving favorite locations, a dark mode UI, and MongoDB integration for storing search history.

This project is open-source under the MIT License, and contributions are welcome. Developers can submit pull requests to improve features or 

report issues. By integrating a simple yet powerful approach to fetching and displaying real-time weather data, this app serves as a great 

learning project for working with APIs, React.js, and backend development with Node.js.
